        <h2>What is AlgoCoin?</h2>
        <p>AlgoCoin utilizes a revolutionary <b> proof-of-inverted-binary-tree consensus algorithm </b> that will absolutely transform the way we think about currency and catapult the
            metaverse to its next major stage: Web 4.0. Using AlgoCoin is simple. Instead of
            hoarding capital in wallets with forgotten passwords, earn AlgoCoin at the time
            of usage through our unique point-of-sale system. Each inverted binary tree
            equates to one AlgoCoin. This means if your chicken tenders cost 420
            AlgoCoin, all you need to do is invert 420 binary trees.
            </p>

            <h2>Where Do I Start?</h2>
            <p>Getting started with AlgoCoin is as easy as reversing a linked list. We
                recommend starting out by practicing on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_editors.asp" target="_blank">AlgoExpert</a>. Next, once you feel
                you can invert binary trees as well as an Ex-FAANG 10x engineer, it's
                time to ditch your fiat currency and enter the future.
